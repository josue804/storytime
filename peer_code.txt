Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?
The README is lacking.  The project needs more commits and the description should be intuitive.  Ex. "add cr for stories".  What is "cr"?
Is there good spec coverage?
The spec coverage seems pretty good; although, i'm not sure if I saw a integration spec.
Do all specs pass? 5 Pending Specs
Is the application logic clear and easy to navigate?
Yes, the logic makes sense to me.
Can you make a test payment through Stripe? No, not available.  Which is a shame, becuase I want to pay for the service.
Is the site user-friendly?
Fairly user friendly.
Are there opportunities for refactoring? I think the code is pretty concise.
What features stand out? It's pretty cool that you were able to go into imgur and grab a bunch of pictures from them and seed the database with them.
What features could be improved?
I don't really see this as a story time builder but more of a image website with comments.  It would be cool to have the comments arrange in a typical story form with a paragraph and such.
It seems that when you create a new story.  The picture with that story does not get saved.  I recieved a random picture.  When I added a contribution to the story, the correct picture was saved.
Do you have any additional constructive criticism or positive feedback to share?
